        "Most of the code is identical to the one above. But there's a few differences. This one was encoded in `utf-8`, so we pass that to decode the data and assign it to the variable `data`. Then we used `seek()` to go to the start of the decoded string and from there, we used `readlines()` to read all the lines in the decoded continuous string separated into lines by `\\n`. After that we selected the first continuous string which will be our columns and assigned it to the variable `header_row`. Initially the string is in raw form, so we used `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace characters from the string. Then we also used the `split()` on the resulting string, which splits the string on the occurance of each comma ( , ) to create a list of items. In our `header_row` there was a empty column `Unnamed: 65`, so we sliced it out of our list.\n",

Then we created an empty list and used a `for-loop` to iterate through each row from all the lines and append the row data to the list to create a LoL."

The third table explains the change in gdp through a span of years, so we can estimate the trajectory economy was heading in before covid and what actually transpired when covid-19 hit.
